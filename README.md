## Project Architecture

The project follows an object-oriented design where each class is responsible for a specific part of the game.

| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `Game` | logic of the game, turn management, game state detection, game results(win,draw), and save/load functionality. |
| `Board` | Stores the board, executes moves, validates positions, detects attacks, and manages board state. |
| `Piece` | Abstract base class for all chess pieces. |
| `Pawn`, `Rook`, `Knight`, `Bishop`, `Queen`, `King` | Implement the movement rules for each chess piece. |
| `Move` | Represents a chess move and stores information required for move execution and undo. |
| `Display` | Renders the chessboard in the console. |
| `Console` | Provides console configuration and Unicode support. |
